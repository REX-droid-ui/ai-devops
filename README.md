This project demonstrates containerization with Docker and automated CI/CD using GitHub Actions to build and push the application to Docker Hub. Built with Python and scikit-learn, it’s a beginner-friendly example of integrating DevOps practices with AI deployment.
Key Features:

Dockerized sentiment analysis app
Automated build and deployment via GitHub Actions
Simple, reproducible setup for learning DevOps and AI
Usage:
